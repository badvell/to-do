# To-Do App

### https://badvell.github.io/to-do-list-app/

## This is a simple and intuitive to-do list application built with React.js. It allows users to add, complete, and remove tasks. The application also saves tasks to localStorage to ensure persistence across page reloads.

### Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks using the input field and pressing the "Add Task" button or by pressing the "Enter" key.

### Complete Tasks: Users can mark tasks as complete, which will strike through the text and move them to the "Completed Tasks" section.

### Remove Tasks: Users can remove tasks from the list.

### Persist Tasks: Tasks are saved to the browser's localStorage to ensure they persist even after the page is reloaded.

## Usage

### Add a Task: Type a task in the input field and press "Enter" or click the "Add Task" button.

### Done a Task: Click the "Done" button next to a task to mark it as completed. The task will move to the "Completed Tasks".

### Remove a Task: Click the "Remove" button next to a task to delete it from the list.
